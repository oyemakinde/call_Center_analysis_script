# call_Center_analysis_script
The purpose of this project was to analyze data collected from call centers across the country over a period starting from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2022. The data was stored in a CSV file named CallCenter.csv, containing various columns such as center name, product reported, number of calls received, number of closed issues, number of open issues, day of the month, month, and year.

To conduct the analysis, the script utilized NumPy and Pandas. The script aimed to generate answers to specific questions based on the provided data. The following questions were addressed:

The total number of calls received by all call centers during the entire period.
The total number of calls received regarding Photoshop during the entire period.
The product that received the highest number of calls in 2020, along with the number of calls for that product.
The year with the highest number of calls and the total number of calls received during that year.
The center with the highest number of calls.
The list of centers arranged in order based on the percentage of closed issues.
A chart displaying the total number of calls in each center.
A chart illustrating the number of calls related to each product.
A chart presenting the distribution of calls over the years.
A chart showcasing the distribution of calls across the centers for each year.
By utilizing NumPy and Pandas functionalities, the script successfully provided insights and visualizations for the aforementioned questions.
